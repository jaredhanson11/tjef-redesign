# TJEF Redesign

## Notes

Keep these in mind when developing:

- the entire website has to be mobile friendly aka it should look as good on a
    phone as it does on the web
- we will find a better font later so don't worry about changing the font, we
    will need to size all the font now (and attributes like bold, italics,
    spacing, etc.) so definitely worry about that in the css

## To-Do List

- [ ] Landing screen - Jacob
    1. determine the proper dimension of background picture
        - will there need to be seperate pictures for mobile vs. web?
        - look into the css height value `vh`
            - 100vh == 100% of viewheight, link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1575141/make-div-100-height-of-browser-window)
    2. layout the title and subtitle on the page and make sure the layout is
       mobile responsive
       - pick the text size for each element
