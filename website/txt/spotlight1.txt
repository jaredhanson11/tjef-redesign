Eric Sodomka (center right) and Okke Schrijvers (center left) are senior scientists at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park. Eric spent countless hours to get four young Nigerian young academics visas, conference fees, and flights to come to Oxford to attend the 14th conference on web and internet economics, a conference on mechanism design. Okke (long standing John Ernest Fellow and member of TJEFâ€™s College of Mentors) connected them to The John Ernest Foundation, which provided their conference fees to help them reach their goals. This project was conceived 1 month ago. Talk about adding value in a timely manner! Conference was held at Oxford University in mid-December, 2018.
