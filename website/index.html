                &emsp;The John Ernest Foundation's role is to turn a dream into a reality.
                Planting ideas, imagining unorthodox relationships, nurturing a passion,
                devising and auditing realistic budgets &ndash; this is our mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                &emsp;The mission is achieved through John Ernest Fellows, who reflect a
                diversity and complexity of human backgrounds and come from most corners
                of the globe.

                    &emsp;What does it mean to become a John Ernest Fellow? It might seem like an
                    easy question, but I am sure that every Fellow would give you a different response.
                    When I look at the definition of mentoring, which, according to Wikipedia, is “a
                    relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to
                    guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person,” I find it to be incomplete.
                    It is a relevant description, but it doesn’t acknowledge the fact that both the mentor
                    and the less knowledgeable person learn through this process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;Mentoring is far deeper than simply teaching, it is being exposed to another
                    world. No matter how wise we claim to be, mentoring teaches us that in fact, our
                    bandwidth is small. Two people not knowing anything but trying to help each
                    other might sound paradoxical, but it is the essence of mentoring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;I propose another definition for mentoring, a definition that grasps the
                    complexity and intensity of these relationships. Sharing mistakes increases negative
                    learning and can be helpful to avoid pitfalls; another benefit is nurturing a growing
                    relationship with increased trust.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;Mentoring is based on love: the love we have for our neighbors, for the
                    children of others, for those who suffer our prejudices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;Mentoring is mathematics, it connects the dots and multiplies the
                    relationships. Mentoring is philosophy, sharing the thoughts and frustrations that
                    burden our ethical urges. Mentoring is dreaming, imagining others later in life,
                    being fulfilled and happy. Mentoring is hope, especially putting hope in the heart of
                    the hopeless. Mentoring is fueled by a sense of purpose. Mentoring is all of that
                    and much more. It is The John Ernest Foundation, it is what we believe and
                    toward what we allocate our time and resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;Talent is in each and every one of us. When we believe in mentoring, we
                    believe in developing relationships to benefit all involved in a particular
                    constellation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &emsp;I grew up in a suburb of Orleans. I saw talent, hope, and fight, but
                    unfortunately, I saw it wasted far too often. I saw lives, which fortune broke. Those
                    hearts filled with hope and passion were dashed into hopelessness. For those with
                    potential who both government and markets left behind, for those who fortune
                    cursed, for those who keep battling life and its ups and downs, I ask you to believe
                    in mentoring and to believe in me.

                    <p>
                    Long before the old word “mentor” again became so fashionable, I well learned the best of definitions from several women and men who helped
                    shape my life. Erwin was chief among them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What the concept came to mean so vividly to me, was a safe haven, where one could live without fear. Authority, while ever present, was overridden
                    by a mutual respect, which the mentor duly earned.<br>
                    <div class="indented">
                    A good mentor listens honestly.<br>
                    A good mentor uses judgment with the utmost care.<br>
                    A good mentor is a master with the chemistry of friendship.<br>
                    A good mentor does not require hearing hints, as she or he wants them told, rather in naked, unabashed language.<br>
                    A good mentor is a patient teacher, and learns when to employ instruction.<br>
                    A good mentor is clever, and understands how temporary disappointment can be.<br>
                    A good mentor is seldom bored by the pupil.<br>
                    And, most important, a good mentor is also in a constant state of learning, and often from the pupil.<br>
                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To me, Erwen was a model mentor.. To the very end, he listened as I learned…agreeing at times with my thoughts and behavior, or critiquing my
                    assumptions.<br>
                    <div class="indented">
                    I always felt important to him.<br>
                    I always felt I could translate what was to me a very complicated world, and that he truly understood and enjoyed hearing its parameters.<br>
                    Never did I feel my world baffled him.<br>
                    </div>
                    We were always equals. Even when I was sixteen.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What so commanded my respect for Erwin was his proper sense of good and evil.<br>
                    <div class="indented">
                    He understood duplicity.<br>
                    He understood false pride and vanity.<br>
                    And, he also taught me that the means to an end, if suspect, were unacceptable.<br>
                    </div>
                    Credibility is a scarce commodity, hard earned. It was to Erwin, among the best of traits.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally, Erwin taught me a lot about competence, which is born in the pursuit of truth, subject to limits, which one should learn, know and practice.<br>
                    <div class="indented">
                    For the competent, ignorance is the ever lurking enemy.<br>
                    While one doesn’t have to experience a car crash to know how painful it can be, it is always imperative to know, to be modern, to
                    experience.<br>
                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    At his home on New Year’s Eve before he passed, Erwin proudly handed us his present, <b>How We Die.</b><br>
                    Even near the end, he was modern. He was learning. He was experiencing.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I am but one small life Erwin touched.<br>
                    <div class="indented">
                    He lives in the many who carry his flame!<br>
                    He wrote, very creatively, on the slate of eternity.<br>
                    </div>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    And it is we, who must pass on these sagacious truths, which will honor his memory.
                    </p>

            <div id="spotlight-description">Eric Sodomka (center right) and Okke Schrijvers (center left) are senior scientists at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park. Eric spent countless hours to get four young Nigerian young academics visas, conference fees, and flights to come to Oxford to attend the 14th conference on web and internet economics, a conference on mechanism design. Okke (long standing John Ernest Fellow and member of TJEF’s College of Mentors) connected them to The John Ernest Foundation, which provided their conference fees to help them reach their goals. This project was conceived 1 month ago. Talk about adding value in a timely manner! Conference was held at Oxford University in mid-December, 2018.</div>
