              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TJEF is a College of Mentors around the world with a passion for turning dreams
              into reality.  Planting ideas, imagining unorthodox relationships, nurturing a
              passion to help John Ernest Fellows, who reflect a diversity and complexity of
              human backgrounds and come from most corners of the globe, achieve their dreams.
            </p>

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We form a treillage, a trellis of trusting friends who have watched the
              Foundation - in a sense - one-by-one - help John Ernest Fellows pave roads of
              growth, professionally, intellectually, personally. Through focusing on
              individuals we set on a multiplier ripple effect.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The John Ernest Foundation's role is to turn a dream into a reality.
                Planting ideas, imagining unorthodox relationships, nurturing a passion,
                devising and auditing realistic budgets.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The mission is achieved through
                John Ernest Fellows, who reflect a diversity and complexity of human
                backgrounds and come from most corners of the globe.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TJEF supports new Initiatives on the basis of need, resource ability and how
                the initiative relates to support the growth of a more humane, more positive
                world. We are fortunate to be able to call on our many generous volunteers
                in the Treillage, who provide relevant expertise, contacts and/or
                sponsorship of a particular Initiative. We provide access predominantly, and
                sometimes funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fellows and Initiatives that we support are generally finite and varied. New
                initiatives are assigned a caretaker “Fellow” who determines and speaks for
                the initiative’s viability. TJEF is an established non-profit entity
                comprised of volunteer staff and we therefore try to cover our
                administrative expenses through voluntary contributions.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Why do we do all of this? We enjoy exercising our responsibility to society.
                By understanding and harnessing this power, it is possible to build a
                cascading effect of kindness, inspiration and dedication. As individuals
                within the Foundation we also devote our time because we learn things beyond
                our daily lives and because we enjoy using the TJEF associations ourselves.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The John Ernest Foundation is based on a simple premise. We want to connect
                our John Ernest Fellows with sources tailored to meet a specific goal. TJEF
                believes in the limitless potential of people to do good for themselves and
                others. Our efforts are not unlike a good old-fashioned Amish barn raising.
                The TJEF community comes together to chip away at accomplishing goals that
                benefit individuals and various groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We see possibility and promise in the faces of those we help. Although
                several of TJEF's objectives strive to expose and reduce horrible suffering,
                we also assist objectives based on spreading friendship, beauty and joy. Our
                College of Mentors works to identify and utilize personal strengths and can
                help focus organizational problems toward a solution.
