                &emsp;TJEF is a College of Mentors around the world with a passion for turning dreams
                into reality.  Planting ideas, imagining unorthodox relationships, nurturing a
                passion to help John Ernest Fellows, who reflect a diversity and complexity of
                human backgrounds and come from most corners of the globe, achieve their dreams.

                &emsp;We form a treillage, a trellis of trusting friends who have watched the
                Foundation - in a sense - one-by-one - help John Ernest Fellows pave roads of
                growth, professionally, intellectually, personally. Through focusing on
                individuals we set on a multiplier ripple effect.

                  &emsp;The John Ernest Foundation's role is to turn a dream into a reality.
                  Planting ideas, imagining unorthodox relationships, nurturing a passion,
                  devising and auditing realistic budgets.

                  &emsp;The mission is achieved through
                  John Ernest Fellows, who reflect a diversity and complexity of human
                  backgrounds and come from most corners of the globe.

                  &emsp;TJEF supports new Initiatives on the basis of need, resource ability and how
                  the initiative relates to support the growth of a more humane, more positive
                  world. We are fortunate to be able to call on our many generous volunteers
                  in the Treillage, who provide relevant expertise, contacts and/or
                  sponsorship of a particular Initiative. We provide access predominantly, and
                  sometimes funding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;Fellows and Initiatives that we support are generally finite and varied. New
                  initiatives are assigned a caretaker “Fellow” who determines and speaks for
                  the initiative’s viability. TJEF is an established non-profit entity
                  comprised of volunteer staff and we therefore try to cover our
                  administrative expenses through voluntary contributions.

                  &emsp;Why do we do all of this? We enjoy exercising our responsibility to society.
                  By understanding and harnessing this power, it is possible to build a
                  cascading effect of kindness, inspiration and dedication. As individuals
                  within the Foundation we also devote our time because we learn things beyond
                  our daily lives and because we enjoy using the TJEF associations ourselves.

                  <p>
                  &emsp;The John Ernest Foundation is based on a simple premise. We want to connect our John Ernest Fellows with sources tailored to meet a specific goal. TJEF
                  believes in the limitless potential of people to do good for themselves and
                  others. Our efforts are not unlike a good old-fashioned Amish barn raising.
                  The TJEF community comes together to chip away at accomplishing goals that
                  benefit individuals and various groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  &emsp;We see possibility and promise in the faces of those we help. Although
                  several of TJEF's objectives strive to expose and reduce horrible suffering,
                  we also assist objectives based on spreading friendship, beauty and joy. Our
                  College of Mentors works to identify and utilize personal strengths and can
                  help focus organizational problems toward a solution.
